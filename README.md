Totally against the massive consumption of time and energy of this new trend of starving-statistical approach of data-steroids named Large Language Models (LLM) I developed an approach of expression of information based on combination of rules based in the research of Hector Zenil and Stephen Wolfram. This approach can be described as follows:
Understanding = compression, compression = abstraction. For me the abstraction goes beyond data availability. In real cognition, what makes the human brain "special" is not how much information we hold, but how we use it, how we combine it, how we "mute" it and how we extend what we know to take decisions for better surviving.
According to the premise (1), Gb on information can be reduced/compressed and abstracted in a few Kb because is not necessary to look for the right answer in the right position of memory or to make a statistical prediction abour what could be the next word or concept, but we can generate it once we have constructed the right rule, just like we can calculate the position of the moon in the next 1000 years, or 1000 years ago with a "simple" mathematical operation
Intelligence is not only about to have an answer, but to test the answer with actions, and actions have consequences on our environment. In this context, I could have a kind of the guru of the mountain (or, let's say, my personal chatGPT) capable to tell me what I want to know, but I need to test the correctness of the answer proving it in the real world. Then I can to change the statement "the right answer" for "the right action" where of course is obvious how the second is more general than the first.

Then, in this project I offered a analysis methodology that finding attractors of information that seems to respect a fractal distribution and seems also to follow the Hollands schemata, this is, the genoma gene distribution in the really sence of finding do-not-care (*) places, abstract a big ammount of information such as a repertoire of 2^16 = 65'536 possible options in a few lines that represent simple rules capable to reproduce instantly the whole amount of information
